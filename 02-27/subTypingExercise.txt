Exercise (Subtyping as Approximation) Consider the following interface and class declarations:
public interface I { public void foo(); }
public class C implements I {
public void foo() { System.out.println("C.foo"); }
public void bar() { System.out.println("C.bar"); }
}
And consider the following code snippet:
I i = new C();
i.foo(); // (A)
i.bar(); // (B)

For lines (A) and (B) above, answer the following questions:
1. Does the line of code type check?
(A) does type checking, and since foo() function exists in the interface I and had concrete implementation in class C, line (A) runs without any issue.
(B) also does type checking. Since bar() function does not exist in the interface I, even though the class C has  bar() implementation, the code is not going to run.

2. If so, what is the output?
As mentione above, line (A) is going to run and print "C.foo" on the terminal, while line (B) is not going to run at all. Error message should follow.
